        Line drawing has become very popular in recent years, making frequent appearances on social media and online editorial design, as well as cosmetic brands, t-shirts, and tote bags!

        Basic line drawing is aesthetically pleasing and creates simple and elegant visual content. It can also be an understated decorative element in your home or office.

        This technique is particularly satisfying for beginners, as line drawings are quick and uncomplicated to create. It's also fun to turn a photograph or complex film sequence into something simpler by using a line drawing to trace over it.While you don't need to be a trained artist or designer to be able to make beautiful line drawings, there's still a fair amount of practice that goes into making elegant lines.
         Pablo Picasso created some of his most famous drawings using only a few well-placed and observed lines.</p>

    Drawing architecture is a fantastic way to challenge your skills and three-dimensional perception.

    While architects learn to hone this skill to a highly technical level, drawing beautiful pieces of architecture is great for artists to learn about detail, volume, perspective, and precision.

    You can copy photographs of beautiful buildings or draw them from real life if you have access to a good view. You can also draw your own architectural pieces from your imagination.

    Committing yourself to learning more about architecture and its methods of drawing can be an incredibly enriching experience. Not only will you gain valuable technical skills, but you'll also develop a keen eye for great architecture and an appreciation of its beauty.

  <h2>Geometric Drawing</h2>

       There's a lot of variety under the umbrella of geometric drawing.

       Geometric drawing involves using geometric shapes to create images. From perspective drawing that turns 2D shapes into 3D illusions to portraits compiled by combining geometric shapes, this drawing style is always fascinating to look at.

       You can start practicing your geometric drawing skills by drawing simple shapes and seeing how you can combine them to form recognizable forms, such as people, animals, objects, etc.

       You can also try experimenting with geometric patterns to create seamless backgrounds. The possibilities for the art you can create with geometry are endless because everything we see can be boiled down to geometry.

       Even trained artists and animators have learned to see shapes in everyday objects and people to translate these on paper accurately.

       It's essential for designers to be able to break things down into geometric shapes so that they can capture and build both the real and the imaginary. Logo design also often relies on geometry to produce elegant, impactful branding.

  <h2>Hatching and Cross-Hatching</h2>
    </div>

      <p class="card-text">Hatching and cross hatching are linear drawing techniques that can be used to create texture, value, and the illusion of form and light. Typically used as an application technique when the medium is linear in nature, hatching and cross hatching are often used together.

        Both techniques work well with a variety of different drawing mediums including pen and ink, graphite, colored pencils, and pastels. Hatching and cross hatching can also be found in traditional printmaking techniques such as etching and engraving.
        
        Some artists prefer to use either hatching or cross hatching in a specific drawing in order to create harmony. Most often however, the two techniques are used together in the same drawing or painting.
        
        While using hatching or crosshatching in a drawing can create a variety of textures, the technique is mostly used to create a full range of value. The placement of values within the work leads to the illusion of the form of the subject as well as the illusion of a defined light source.</p>
