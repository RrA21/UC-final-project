       What is special about oil painting?<br>
        Image result for oil painting
        The advantages of oil for painting images include "greater flexibility, richer and denser colour, the use of layers, and a wider range from light to dark". But the process is slower, especially when one layer of paint needs to be allowed to dry before another is applied.</p>

          If you are comfortable mixing colors, you can start out with the bare minimum and simply buy individual tubes of white, black, red, blue and yellow paints.</p>

        <p class="card-text"> Once you start painting you will quickly learn what shapes and sizes of brush you gravitate toward, and what effects you’re hoping to achieve.

          For a starter, a selection of one or two small, medium and large round brushes, respectively, should be enough to educate you on what your painting preferences are.</p>

        <p class="card-text">With oil paint, you don’t clean your brushes in water; instead, you clean them with a paint thinning solution. While “turpentine” is a catch all phrase for this substance, these days, mixtures of odorless mineral spirits are a common substitute.</p>

        <p class="card-text">You’ll need some sort of vessel to store your turpentine or mineral spirits for cleaning your brushes as you paint. A jar with a coil inside is ideal for cleaning your brushes. You can fill it with your turpentine or mineral spirit mixture, and gently rub the bristles of the brush against the coil to remove excess paint. Jars like this are available at art supply stores.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Linseed oil</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Many beginners get confused about the difference between linseed oil and turpentine or mineral spirits. Like the mineral spirits, linseed oil will dilute oil paint. However, its oil base makes it a softer medium to use to thin your oil paint to attain an ideal consistency without losing the paint’s texture. You’ll use linseed oil almost like you would use water to thin watercolor paint.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Easel</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> all artists, prefer to paint with an easel. It’s not required, but it may help you from hunching while you paint. If you’re just getting started, it’s a good idea to start basic. Try to find a used easel (they’re often found at yard sales and secondhand stores) or invest in a small tabletop easel for minimal investment. Painting on this “starter” easel can inform you of your preferences, so that when it is time to buy a good one, you’ll know what you are looking for.</p>

        <p class="card-text">it’s just the term for the surface upon which you mix your paint. It can be a large piece of glass or ceramic or even a disposable books of palette pages sold at art supply stores. Be sure that it’s large enough for what you’re doing, though. You want plenty of room to mix colors and “spread out” on the palette without feeling too crowded.</p>

        <p class="card-text">When you’re ready to paint in oil, you’ll need something to paint on. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t have to be canvas. As long as you treat a surface with gesso, which acts as  a “primer” and keeps the paint from deteriorating the surface beneath, you can paint on just about any surface, from thick paper to wood to yes, the popular pre-stretched canvas.</p>
